<h3><font face="times new roman">My name is Lacy Finnigan, and I am a BCIS major at the University of North Texas, graduating in December of 2015. I have created this website to demonstrate the skills I have learned through my post-secondary education by not only stating these skills in a resume, but attaching the project files I created for classes.
<p>
You can contact me via this website, email, or phone with the information provided on the "Contact Me" section of the website.

I hope to hear from you!
